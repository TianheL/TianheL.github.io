Hi! I am Tianhe Lin, a first-year master's student at [School of Data Science, Fudan University](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/). 
I'm a member of [Knowledge Works Lab](http://kw.fudan.edu.cn/) led by Prof. [Yanghua Xiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=odFW4FoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Prof. [Deqing Yang](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/c1/56/c22442a508246/page.htm).
I received my bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) in June 2024.

I am fortunate to collaborate with researchers from both academia and industry.
Previously, I interned at Meituan, where I focused on research on LLM-as-a-judge ‍⚖️, and developed several generative judge models 🤖 for open-ended, challenging and [automatic evaluation](https://agi-eval.cn/evaluation/LLM-CN-Subj-1-Rnd?id=48) of post-trained LLMs on how they align to human preference.

**Research Interests:**  I have a broad interest in Natural Language Processing. Specifically, I am interested in (but are not limited to):
- **Reasoning Capabilities:** Interpreting and enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.
- **Evaluation:** Automatic and reliable evaluation of LLMs, e.g., LLM-as-a-judge.

Besides research, I enjoy cycling🚴‍♀️, marathon🏃‍♂️ and badminton🏸.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my work or want to discuss a potential collaboration!
